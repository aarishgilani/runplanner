# Runplanner
For Runners . By Runner!

Backed by polarized/pyramidal training intensity published in sports science journal, runner planner helps build weekly run plans to avoid overuse injuries and optimize your weekly routines. 

## Current Progress
- We have build out an algorithm backed by [Factors Affecting Training and Physical Performance in Recreational Endurance Runners](Factors Affecting Training and Physical Performance in Recreational Endurance Runners) research published in PubMed Central journal.
- A landing page for the product
- A client side SPA app based on vite-react-router based starter 

## Next steps
- Build inner page describing the inner workings of the algorithm - open source
- Build a page and implement the tool
- Minor refinements to homepage
- Build privacy policy and disclaimer this site does not provide medical advice and we are not responsible for the use of this tool, nor gaurantee anything. 

## Furture plans
- Login portal
- Save runs 
- Sync with Strava, Fitbit, Garmin
- Build charts and provide stats and metric enhanced for free
- Integrate with ML to build predictions and marathon, half-marathon, 10k plans.
